# rustmarching

fun project built with rust
wanted to check out how well web-assembly and rust worked
thought the best way to do this would be rendering some nice 3d spheres with a raymarching technique

really cool development experience

still actually deploy to a server instead of just locally

also need to use webworkers to parallelize the rendering or wait for rust-wasm to support multithreading
